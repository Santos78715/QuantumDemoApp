Hi! I've created the Assigned task i.e application named "QuantumDemo". 

The major framework and libraries used are:

1)  Firebase :         User Authentication -> Whenever the user register into the app, their data i.e user and password 
                       is stored into the firebase. 
                       I've provided the functionality to login through the Email and Password or Google.

2)  Retrofit:          Retrofit is used to perform HTTP request to the server. We can perform variety of operation like fetching
                       data and storing data into the server through the use of API.

3) Glide :             Glide is basically used to load and process images from various  sources.
                       In our case, it is used to create image via the image link provided within json file.

4) Recycler view:      Recycler View is basically used to recycle the views so that we donot have to create and load views each time.
                       Each individual element in the list is defined by a view holder object. When the view holder is created, 
                       it doesn't have any data associated with it. After the view holder is created, the RecyclerView binds it to its data.
                       The RecyclerView requests views, and binds the views to their data, by calling methods in the adapter.



Note: I would have use Jetpack architecture component along with Data binding, View Binding and but due to the shortage of time provided
to complete the task, i didn't got enough time to think and design the application. If some extra time is provided i'ld use the better frameworks
and libraries along with navigation components.
